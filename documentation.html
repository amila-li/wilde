                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><i>The Wilde Trials International Archive</i> is a textbase and
                    text-sharing detection program for analyzing international news
                    reports about the three trials and imprisonment of Oscar Wilde. Wilde’s three trials
                    were an international media event in the spring of 1895 and were
                    front­page news the world over for nearly a two-month period,
                    triggering debates about sexuality, justice, and press
                    standards. The textbase contains news reports published
                    in 1895 which have been gathered from newspapers around the
                    world in a number of languages.</p>
