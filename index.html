        <h2>Oscar Wilde Arrested!</h2>
        <p>The <i>Wilde Trials International News Archive</i> gathers international news reports
          covering the three trials of Anglo-Irish playwright Oscar Wilde (1854-1900). Wilde’s
          trials were a global media event in the spring of 1895, triggering important debates about
          gender expression and sexuality, family relations, press standards, and the principle of
          art for art’s sake. You can now browse, search, and compare news reports from around the
          world to learn how coverage of the Wilde trials circulated across borders and languages.
